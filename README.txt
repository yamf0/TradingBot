The project namede TradingBot *Name to be discussed* is created for the initial purpose of learning advanced skills of Data analysis within a Python framework. The project aims to firstly dowload the information for several Cryptocurrencies in different exchanges and timeframes by the use of either an existing API or web-scrapping. 
The information obtained of the markets is then going to be used and worked on using different data analysis//visualization tools in Python in order to achieve a clean und understandable outcome.
Finally, using a mixture of statistical techniques and data analysis techniques, the Bot will be able to access a determined exchange through its API and place buy//sell orders for a given cryptocurrency. The Bot is able to independently analyze the market and know when a given cryptocurrency is a good prospect for a profit on a trade. 

----QUICK START----

The initial step for working with the repository is to have a 3.6 or further Python version installed. A requirements.txt will be included in order to download all the necessary libraries for succesfully running the code. 
Then, an API key will be requiered by each user saved under a json filed under the name "API_KEY" under the folder named "access_keys". The API keys must be provided by each user and will be for both the data download and the exchange. This is in order to prevent any missuse of other developers API's
