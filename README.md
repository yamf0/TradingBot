# Trading Bot
----
The project is created for the initial purpose of learning advanced skills of Data analysis within a Python framework. The project aims to firstly dowload the information for several Cryptocurrencies in different exchanges and timeframes by the use of either an existing API or web-scrapping. The information obtained of the markets is then going to be used and worked on using different data analysis//visualization tools in Python in order to achieve a clean und understandable outcome. Finally, using a mixture of statistical techniques and data analysis techniques, the Bot will be able to access a determined exchange through its API and place buy//sell orders for a given cryptocurrency. The Bot is able to independently analyze the market and know when a given cryptocurrency is a good prospect for a profit on a trade.

## QUICK START
---
1. The initial step for working with the repository is to have a 3.6 or further Python version installed.
2. The code should be developed and run by a virtual enviroment created with the above mentioned python version, to know the steps on how to set up the virtual env follow the instructions on **Tutorials/virtual_env**
2. A requirements.txt will be included in order to download all the necessary libraries for succesfully running the code. To install the required libraries follow the instructions on **Tutorials/requirements.txt**
3. Then, an API key will be requiered by each user saved under a json filed under the name "API_KEY" under the folder named "access_keys". The API keys must be provided by each user and will be for both the data download and the exchange. This is in order to prevent any missuse of other developer's API keys

## CONTRIBUTORS
---
A big thanks is due to the inital contributors of this project Hugo Armando, Angel Avalos and Yael Martinez since they created the project. Any further contributors are welcome as well and will be thanked once more contributions to the project are made. This Bot is useful to any person who wants to make some passive income by playing the cryptomarkets. Any contributions or interested users of becoming contributions please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.txt file in the repository. All help is most welcome.

## Tutorials

### * Virtual Enviroment

1. in a Terminal instal the package for python virtual enviroment using pip
```js
python -m pip instal virtual enviroment
```
*the above command depends on the enviroment
2. set up the virtual enviroment in the folder named **pyvirtual**
```js
python -m virtualenv pyvirtual
```
3. Activate the virtual env in the terminal to be used for execution
*For Linux
```js
source pyvirtual/bin/activate
```
*For windows
```js
pyvirtual/bin/activate
```

### * Requierements.txt
pip offers a way to automatically instal all the dependencies used in an enviroment by a requirements.txt.
Since a virtual enviroment is used then only requiered libraries will be isntalled. Before the installation the virtual enviroment must be activated, otherwise the requirements will be installed in your default python path.
To instal the requirements follow:
```js
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a new dependency is added to the code the an update to the requirements is required. To do so follow:
```js
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
